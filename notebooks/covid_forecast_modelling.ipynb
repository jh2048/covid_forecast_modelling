    "# COVID Forecast Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "When COVID presented a new challenge for modelling, the models used for forecasting developed. Traditionally, an SIR model has been used. Advancing introduced the SEIR model. Even then, it was difficult to forecast the effects of COVID. There have been further developments in this area that use agent-based models to reinact the behaviours and profiles of people that will affect their exposure, their chances of infection, their chances of asymptomatic presentation of the virus and of course, the recovery outcome. This problem is not a simple one when we consider the variations in physiology and their environment, including not only factors such as population density but also cultural differences and the decisions made by the world leaders. For more information about the complicated nature of forecasting COVID, this [article](https://media.nature.com/original/magazine-assets/d41586-020-01003-6/d41586-020-01003-6.pdf) gives a high-level overview of the challenges and trails that were experienced by professionals modelling the virus.

    "In order to tackle this challenge, I have chosen to develop on a prepared model whose author [Boris Tseytlin](https://github.com/btseytlin) is experienced in the area with [publications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08048) to support their work.  Data in this model was taken from a freely available [source](https://yandex.ru/covid19/stat) which gives values for COVID related information from Moscow. \n",

    "The parameters, input values and assumptions used to build this model are based on real-world information from Moscow. We seen that during COVID, each world leader made decisions to handle and reduce the effects of the virus on their population. "

    "We can use the code here to evaluate how well fitted this model would be on data from other countries. Given that his model forecasts not only the visible deaths and infections, but the invisible; this gives a more real-world alternative forecasting that may be more indicative of true numbers that were seen during the pandemic."

    "- **Duplication and erroneous entry of Country names:** Taking a look at the countries that were included in the data, it was found that there are some duplicate countries that have been entered with inconsistent names that do not match.\n",
    "- **Observation Frequency:** Dates running from 01/22/2020 to 08/29/2020, tell us that there is a total 221 days of recorded data. As our first run through, we will concentrate on countries that were able to consistently provide observations for each day.\n",
    "- **Dates reliability:** Comparing the two possible date columns shows that nearly 85000 dates do not match between Last Update and ObservationDate which isn't necessarily a problem depending on the definition of the data in the columns. <span style=\"color:red\"> ASSUMPTION!: </span> If we take a look at the data values that aren't matching, we can see that the dates of Last Updates can either be before or after the ObservationDate. Assuming that the 'LastUpdate' refers to the datetime of any initial entries, updates or amendments to the data values, it would appear odd that values for any given ObservationDate would be submitted before the date had passed.\n",
    "- **Observation Frequency by Country/ State:** There were significant differences between the number of observations for each country. From this we could see that some countries had submitted data for the entire country, while some countries had submitted data for sub areas of the countries. We do not see consistent result entries for states within the US. Japan's entries are consistent across the states however, we only seem to have 94 observation dates. Trying a few states, we can see that the data for the Japanese states only covers a small span of time which is consistent through may to August\n",

    "Since there is some consistency issues with some of the countries submissions, we decided to remove them since we've already decided to work only with countries that have ObservationDates for each date between 01/22/2020 to 08/29/2020.\n",

    "\n",
    "Within this new dataset, we managed to find Thailand with a simple match, Taiwan and Hong Kong required a fuzzy match using regex best match algorithm. However, we were still missing South Korea and the chinese states (even if we increase the error rate threshold). String approximation methods and NLP techniques can be used to enhance the search (such Levenshtein, Mongue-Elkan, Dependency Parsing, etc.) but for this particular project, it isn't worth spending the time to create a function for it. So let's just go and find the data. A little research and we find that South Korea can also be referred to as the 'Republic of Korea' which matches the entry in our new dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chinese states were harder to get population statistics for since the data source we were using only contained population statistics for countries. Since we couldn't find a reputable source (without paying for it) which listed all of the chinese states, we've taken data from Wikipedia for the states that we could find (Source: National Bureau of Statistics) :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_China#Population_density_and_distribution\n",

We creates a column containing the cumulative sum of the data points over time to capture the tally as time went on. Next, we merged our dataframes and renamed our columns. Finally pickling our file for use in the model."

We can see from the data in the table that the model was unable to perform better than the baseline in all cases. This may be due to the quaratine multiplier based on Russian / Moscow lockdown laws. However, we can still compare the rates between countries and how well the model performed.\n",

    "### Summary of results:\n",
    "- For models when the baseline was low to 0, if we refer to the plots produced in the Data preparation stage (`notebooks/data_preparation_countries`), we can see that the number of deaths started to plateau in Mainland China (which covers all chinese states). This is a suggestion that the strict lockdown precautions in Mainland China were effective in reducing the spread of the virus.\n",
    "- Comparably, we see that the baseline of Taiwan was also low, given the high population density which seems to correspond to higher baseline and model error rates, this seems anomolous, especially when referencing to the lockdown measures which were more relaxed than the other countries / states being compared here.\n",
